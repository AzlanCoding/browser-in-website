# browser-in-website
This project is to help students bypass websites blocked by schools device manager apps (e.g. Mobile guardian) to do reaserch.
It makes use of iframe to do so.
Using this extension to help the site work: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe
This extension ignores X-frame-headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers.
**I did not make this extension, someonelse did.
